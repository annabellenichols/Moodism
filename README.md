Moodism
=======
**Barbara, Judy, and Annabelle's COMP346 final project**

Our project consists of a mood quiz with a homepage, 5 questions and a final screen displaying a mood token. To run it, simply enter `node app.js` in the command promp (after navigating to the appropriate folder). Then, open your browser and enter `http://localhost:8080/`. This will take you to our homepage and you can follow from there. This website has been tested and found to be compatible with Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

In case it isn't clear, you can navigate between the pages using either the "continue" button, the side buttons (except that you can't visit the next question without completing the previous one) and the arrow keys (same applies).

We hope you enjoy it!
