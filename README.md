Moodism
=======
Barbara, Judy, and Annabelle's COMP346 final project.

Our project consists of a mood quiz with a homepage, 5 questions and a final screen displaying a mood token. To run it, simply click on "index.html" and follow from there. All pages are connected, so you will not need to open any files directly after this. Please use Firefox to view this website, as Chrome does not display the whole website (it argues that the Same Origin Policy is violated through the AJAX calls). This problem will obviously disappear once we put the relevant javascript in a server. Also, please note that only one mood token is displayed in the final page (i.e. at this point, all answer combinations give the same result). In the future, this will change as we will vary the final mood token based on the previous answers.

We tried to improve the website based on the usability results we got. In case it isn't clear, you can navigate between the pages using either the "continue" button, the side buttons (except you can't visit the next question without completing the previous one) and the arrow keys (same applies).

We hope you enjoy it!
